Quickly build simple parametric models of protoplanetary disks based on the numerous papers which have previously done so, for example [Dartois et al. (2003)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2003A&A...399..773D), [Andrews et al. (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ApJ...744..162A) and [Williams and Best (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...788...59W) to name but a few.

See the [examples] Notebooks for a guide on how it works.
